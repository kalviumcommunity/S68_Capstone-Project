My Capstone Project - React App Initialization

Introduction
Welcome to my Capstone project! This is a simple README file to explain how I set up the frontend for my project using React and Vite. The goal of this section is to initialize the React app and make sure everything is ready for further development.

What I Did
Created a new React app using Vite (a fast build tool) to get the frontend up and running.
Pushed the app to GitHub so it's accessible online for collaboration.
Requested AI review for the code to ensure everything looks good and follows best practices.
